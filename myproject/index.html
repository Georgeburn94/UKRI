      <h2>üìú About me</h2>
      <p>
        With a unique blend of graphic design, web development, and a strong STEM background, I bring the right skills
        for simplifying complex scientific concepts into engaging content. My experience in science
        communication and visual storytelling aligns well with STFC‚Äôs mission to drive innovation through digital media.
      <p>
        With a <strong>Postgraduate Diploma in Graphic Design</strong> (Leeds Arts University) and a <strong>Batchelor's
          degree in Biology</strong> (University of Sussex), I combine both an understanding and interest in science
        with strong creative chops. This makes me well uniquely placed to create digital products that engage and
        inform.
